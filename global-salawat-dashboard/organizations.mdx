## Introduction

The Organizations page allows you to add new organizations, generate unique referral links, and manage existing organizations associated with the challenge. Use this guide to understand each feature and learn how to use the page effectively.

## Features

### 1. **Add New Organization**

- At the top of the page, this section allows you to add an organization with a unique referral link for tracking purposes. Here’s how to fill out each field:
    - **Name**: Enter the name of the organization.
    - **Unique Referral Link**: Enter a custom source name for the organization. This will automatically generate a **Full URL** that you can share with the organization.
    - **Full URL**: This is the unique link generated based on the source name. It can be copied directly by clicking **Copy Full URL** and shared with the organization for tracking referrals.
    - **Photo URL**: Paste the URL of the organization’s logo or photo to visually represent them in the list.
- Once all fields are complete, click **Submit Organization** to save the new organization entry.

### 2. **Organizations Table**

- The **Organizations** table lists all the organizations added to the system, displaying key information and allowing easy access to their referral links and other actions.
- **Columns**:
    - **Name**: The name of the organization.
    - **Organization Logo**: A link to the organization’s logo or photo.
    - **Unique Referral Link**: The custom referral link generated for the organization, displayed in two parts:
        - **Full URL**: Shows the complete referral link for easy copying. Click **Copy Full URL** to copy the link to your clipboard.
        - **Edit source**: Allows you to modify the unique source identifier (the part of the URL after `?src=`) if needed. Simply click on it, edit the text, and save changes.
- **Delete Button**: Located on the far right of each row, this button allows you to remove an organization from the list. Click "Delete" to confirm the removal.

### 3. **Export to CSV**

- Click the **Export to CSV** button to download a CSV file containing the list of all organizations and their referral information. This is useful for offline record-keeping or analyzing the data in spreadsheet applications.

### 4. **Filters**

- Below the Export to CSV button, there are filters to help you narrow down the list of organizations:
    - **Filter by name**: Type the name of an organization to display only matching entries in the table.
    - **Page Size**: Use this dropdown to select the number of entries displayed per page (e.g., 10, 25, 50).

### 5. **Pagination**

- If there are more organizations than can fit on a single page, use the pagination controls at the bottom of the table to navigate through pages. You can go to a specific page by clicking the page number or use the "Next" button to move forward.
