- After filling out all required fields, click **Submit Pledge** to save the entry.

### 2. **Pledges Table**

### 3. **Export to CSV**

- The **Export to CSV** button allows you to download the entire list of pledges in a CSV file format. This is helpful for keeping offline records or further analyzing pledge data in spreadsheet software like Excel.

### 4. **Filters**

- This section, below the date filters, lets you narrow down the pledge list by different criteria:
    - **Filter by Email**: Type an email address to show only pledges made by that email.
    - **Select Country**: Use this dropdown to display pledges from a specific country.
    - **Filter by Source**: Type a source name to filter by a specific origin of the pledges (e.g., “Event 2024”).
    - **Page Size**: Use this dropdown to adjust the number of rows displayed per page (e.g., 10, 25, 50).
- **Date Filters**: Above the filters, you can specify a date range for viewing pledges. Set the **From Date** and **To Date** fields to show pledges within a specific timeframe. Clear the fields using the “X” icon to reset.

### 5. **Pagination**

- At the bottom of the pledges table, pagination controls allow you to navigate between pages if there are more pledges than can fit on one page. Use the numbered buttons to go directly to a page or the "Next" button to move forward.

### 6. **Countries Added**

- At the bottom of the page, you’ll find the **Countries Added** section, which displays a list of all the countries that have joined the challenge and the date each country was first added.
- This list updates as new countries join, helping you track the geographical reach of the challenge.
